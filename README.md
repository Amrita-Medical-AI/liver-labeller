# Liver-labeller
A simple-to-use web application to facilitate labelling at source during an liver ultrasound procedure. A liver ultrasound can show signs of fat storage in your liver (steatotic liver disease), inflammation and swelling (hepatitis), and scar tissue (fibrosis or cirrhosis). This timestamps the visibility of liver on the video.
